IN 1972, during the restoration of the Great Mosque of Sana'a, in Yemen, 
laborers working in a loft between the structure's inner and outer roofs 
stumbled across a remarkable gravesite, although they did not realize it 
at the time. Their ignorance was excusable: mosques do not normally house 
graves, and this site contained no tombstones, no human remains, no funereal 
jewelry. It contained nothing more, in fact, than an unappealing mash of old 
parchment and paper documents—damaged books and individual pages of Arabic text, 
fused together by centuries of rain and dampness, gnawed into over the years by 
rats and insects. Intent on completing the task at hand, the laborers gathered 
up the manuscripts, pressed them into some twenty potato sacks, and set them 
aside on the staircase of one of the mosque's minarets, where they were locked 
away—and where they would probably have been forgotten once again, were it not 
for Qadhi Isma'il al-Akwa', then the president of the Yemeni Antiquities Authority, 
who realized the potential importance of the find.
